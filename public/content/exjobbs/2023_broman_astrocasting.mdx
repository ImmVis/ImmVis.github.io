[OpenSpace](https://openspaceproject.com) is an open-source software that aims to visualize our entire known universe in its accurate context.  It is a mature software that can be used by anyone to tell stories about the cosmos and our place in it.  One of the fundamental goals from early in the design was the desire for users to share live presentations from geographically distant locations;  being able to experience the same presentation from different places on Earth.  This feature enables multiple presenters to hand-off control between each other for a truly collaborative presentation to multiple audiences.  Thus far, this goal has remained elusive.  The support for ad-hoc sessions exists, but it requires a level of setup that is infeasible for the average user.  This project will require familiarity with C++ and JavaScript/TypeScript.
The goal of this Exjobb is to develop a system that can be used by anyone in the world running OpenSpace to host a session that can be discovered and joined by other OpenSpace users across the globe.  This work consists of two parts:
  1. Designing a webpage where users can create sessions they are hosting than can be either private or public.  Other users can discover ongoing sessions and choose to join them from within OpenSpace.
  2. Developing the underlying backend infrastructure to ensure that the configuration options within OpenSpace are compatible enough when joining a session.  This would include synchronizing required resources to the joining party, detecting optional and non-optional dependencies.

## About OpenSpace
[OpenSpace](https://openspaceproject.com) is open-source software that aims to visualize the entire known universe in accurate three-dimensional space.  It is mature science visualization software that can be used by anyone to tell stories about the cosmos and our place in it.

## The Project
One feature currently lacking in OpenSpace is the ability to visualize black holes. Doing this interactively is not trivial but has been done recently in a research paper. The goal of this thesis is to use the methods mentioned in this paper and implement a similar black hole visualization within OpenSpace. The focus of the project will be to make the visualization interactable so users will be able to fly around the black hole freely.

The gravitational pull of black holes is so extreme that when light passes by, its path is bent. This makes the process of visualizing a black hole similar to ray-tracing, except in this case the rays no longer travel in straight paths but bend along the way depending on the gravitational pull and the spin of the black hole. Since ray-tracing is already a difficult task in real-time, this project will focus heavily on efficiency and speed. Computations will have to be done on the GPU to strive for a visualization that can be viewed interactively.

Useful courses for this project are Advanced Global Illumination and Rendering, Data Structures, Multicore and GPU Programming, Scientific Visualization, all C++ courses, all computer graphics courses, and of course all the math and physics courses.

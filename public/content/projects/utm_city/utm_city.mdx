Management of unmanned traffic, such as drone deliveries and taxis, is important for
future logistics for industry and availability, as well as for environment and safety.
The UTM City platform is a software suite consisting primarily of a drone service,
drone traffic, and drone management simulator, and a touch-based user interface for
scenario design, simulation control, and drone traffic control and visualization.

This platform has been developed since 2016 through several collaboration projects with
LFV, with various funding sources, and used for a wide range of applications ranging from
demonstration, visualization and exemplification in workshops to real-time planning and
management of real drone traffic.

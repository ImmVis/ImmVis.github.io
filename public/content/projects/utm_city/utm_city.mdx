The UTM (unmanned traffic management, for air traffic in cities) area is developing rapidly, but not for urban environments. The core challenge is to handle high levels of urban air traffic, with a human in the loop, and with a high level of automation and autonomous systems. In the project, the aim is to increase our understanding of this future situation, and to explore new concepts for understanding and controlling traffic. The UTM CITY project is based on the research through design methodology. According to the methodology, a design (UTM concept) is constructed at the same time as a context is built up (a simulated urban environment with drone traffic) together with problem owners and other stakeholders. Supporting this method, we build a simulation and visualization enviornment, UTM CITY, where designs and situations can be tested. UTM CITY is a collaboration between LiU and LFV.

The project is funded by the Swedish Transport Administration.

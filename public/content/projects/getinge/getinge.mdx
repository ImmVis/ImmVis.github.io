# About
The Getinge dome production was a collaboration between Linköping University and
[Getinge](getinge.com), a Swedish company that provides technical solutions and
products to hospitals and life science institutions.
The goal of the project was to create dome movies that featured three different upcoming
Getinge products, for an internal launch event that Getinge hosted in Gothenburg in
September 2023.

# The Production
The dome movies where created using Unreal Engine 5 and the new [render pipeline](/projects/unreal_engine_fisheye_rendering) that
had just been created by ImmVis and the Wisdome group. The Getinge dome movies
offered an opportunity to test this new pipeline at production level, whereas before
it had mostly been tested on smaller examples.

# Unreal Engine Render Pipeline
By utilizing the real time rendering capabilities of Unreal Engine 5, the project time
could be greatly reduced due to the immense gains in rendering performance.
The large scale of dome movies, requiring 8k frames at max resolution, would have meant
weeks of rendering time with classic rendering pipelines, especially when rendering movies in
stereo, as this effectively doubles the amount of frames needed. Thanks to the
Unreal Engine render pipeline, the render time could be reduced from weeks to hours.
Without it, a production like this would not have been feasible within the tight time frame given.

# The Getinge Products
The production was split up into three movies, covering three different Getinge products
that where all launching in the near future.
Since all three products could be maintained within the same Unreal Engine project,
the idea was that synergies with reusable assets and an established render pipeline
could make the work more efficient.

## Cardiohelp
A machine that can help patients that are suffering from heart- or lung failiure. It pulls blood from the patient that is oxygenated externally and then reintroduced into the patient, temporarly replacing the internal oxygenation process and gives the patient time to recover.

## Bioreactor
A controlled environment that allows cells to grow in higher numbers and produce molecules such as antibodies, which can then be extracted and used in medical applications to cure diseases. 

## Aquadis
A dishwasher for clinical industrial use that cleans and disinfects medical tools.

# Storytelling and designing for the Dome Experience
A goal of the production was to create an experience in the dome that exceeded that
of a traditional product visualization. Movies in a dome environment, especially when utilizing
3D stereo effects, are more immersive than regular 2D videos. 
To take advantage of this environment, a lot of the scenes where designed to encapsulate the audience, giving the impression that you are inside the movie.
The nature of the dome environment posed several challenges.
## Scale of the dome relative to the scene
You have to accomodate for the scale of the dome that the video will be shown on when designing the scenes. The dome in Norrköping has a radius of 7 meters, and the one in Gothenburg is even bigger. This means that objects on screen should not be too close to the camera as this will look strange, especially in stereo. This can be remedied either by ensuring sufficient distance between the objects in the scene and the camera, or by scaling down the camera (the distance between the stereo eyes) which essentially increases the realtive distance to objects. The latter is needed when the objects that you want to show are quite small and you still want to get close to them, such as the Bioreactor or Cardiohelp.
## Camera motion
When deciding camera paths in the dome it is important to never move to fast, as this will make the audience motion sick. This was a limitation for the commercial format that the Getinge movies had, as you want to show as much as possible in as little time as possible, with quick motions and jump cuts. 
In some scenes it was possible to move quick, as most of the surrounding scene was black and the feeling was that the objects in the scene were moving, while more crowded scenes limitied us to slower camera motion. 

# Bringing Getinge CAD Models into Unreal Engine (This is too detailed)
The CAD models of the products where provided by Getinge. By using [Datasmith](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/datasmith) to bring the CAD models into Unreal Engine, operations could be run on the imported
geometry, such as tessellation to ensure high geometry resolution and conversion
to [Nanite](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/nanite-virtualized-geometry-in-unreal-engine/) for increased performance. Once imported into Unreal Engine, the largest work load was creating materials
and adding them correctly to the models, as there wasn't an obvious material mapping
in the CAD models provided by Getinge.

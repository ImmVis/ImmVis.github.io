# About
The Getinge dome production was a collaboration between Link√∂ping University and
[Getinge](getinge.com), a Swedish company that provides technical solutions and
products to hospitals and life science institutions.
The goal of the project was to create dome movies that featured three different upcoming
Getinge products, for an internal launch event that Getinge hosted in Gothenburg in
September 2023.

# The Production
The dome movies where created using Unreal Engine 5 and the new [render pipeline](example.com) that
had just been created by ImmVis and the Wisdome group. The Getinge dome movies
offered an opportunity to test this new pipeline at production level, whereas before
it had mostly been tested on smaller examples.

# Unreal Engine Render Pipeline
By utilizing the real time rendering capabilities of Unreal Engine 5, the project time
could be greatly reduced due to the immense gains in rendering performance.
The large scale of dome movies, requiring 8k frames at max resolution, would have meant
weeks of rendering time with classic rendering pipelines, especially when rendering movies in
stereo, as this effectively doubles the amount of frames needed. Thanks to the
Unreal Engine render pipeline, the render time could be reduced from weeks to hours.
Without it, a production like this would not have been feasible within the tight time frame given.

# The Different Products
The production was split up into three movies, covering three different Getinge products
that where all approaching launch.
Since all three products could be maintained within the same Unreal Engine project,
the idea was that synergies with reusable assets and an established render pipeline
could make the work more efficient.

# Bringing Getinge CAD Models into Unreal Engine
The CAD models of the products where provided by Getinge. By using [Datasmith](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/datasmith) to bring the CAD models into Unreal Engine, operations could be run on the imported
geometry, such as tessellation to ensure high geometry resolution and conversion
to [Nanite](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/nanite-virtualized-geometry-in-unreal-engine/) for increased performance. Once imported into Unreal Engine, the largest work load was creating materials
and adding them correctly to the models, as there wasn't an obvious material mapping
in the CAD models provided by Getinge.

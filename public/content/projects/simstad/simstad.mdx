SimStad is a multipart project with an overall goal of collecting and
visualizing data of cities for city maintainance and planning, and
public outreach.

# Classification using deep learning
Municipals spend a lot of time and resources each year collecting data
from their cities. By using deep learning semantic segmentation (AI), some of
this data can automatically be converted into GIS-data (Geographic
Information System), leaving more time and resources for other work.


# Image enhancement
The quality of drone and aircraft photos is not always enough. By using
deep learning, images from drones and aircrafts can be improved by for
example increasing the resolution, removing certain objects, or removing
shadows.


# Exhibition at Norrköping Visualization Center C
A large 3D-print of Norrköping has been created as a part of an exhibit
at Visualization Center C. Projectors can show various datasets on the
3D-model, such as flooding risks and noise levels in the city.


# Digital twin
A digital twin of Norrköping will be created as a tool to better
understand the city.

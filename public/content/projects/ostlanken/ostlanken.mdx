# About
The Ostlänken exhibition was a collaboration between Linköping University, Visualiseringscenter C, Trafikverket, Norrköping municipality and SWECO. The  goal was to create content for a townhall meeting at Visualiseringscenter C about the planned changes to city planning related to the Ostlänken high speed train railway. The project was built in Unreal Engine 5 and produced a touch screen application, a [2D movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJ0Yq4mUf0U) and a [dome movie](https://visualiseringscenter.se/show/ostlanken-framtidens-norrkoping/). 

# Contributors
This section lists the main contributors to the content in the Unreal Engine project, and roughly who worked on what.

## Linköping University
The main application was built by Linköping University. This includes the pipeline for importing CAD data and displaying geographical data. The interaction and any "gameplay elements" where built by LiU, as well as the dome movie rendering that was done with our [in-house dome rendering pipeline](/guides/unreal_engine_fisheye_rendering/).

## Norrköping municipality
Norrköping municipality worked on the level design of the city district Butängen as well as the rail station, designed by the architect firm Wingårdhs. They also produced the [2D movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJ0Yq4mUf0U) about the Ostlänken project.

## SWECO
SWECO worked on the CAD models for the high speed railway infrastructure.

# Data
At its core this project is about showing CAD and geographical data, both 3D and 2D, together in the context of a city that the end user can explore on their own. This section explains the types of data that were used and the source of them.

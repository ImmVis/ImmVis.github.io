# About

Ecoweb let you explore the food web in geographical areas. Find out how species depend on each other and learn how loss of species affect the entire ecosystem.

The simulation is based on research in theoretical ecology at Linköping University. The goal is to teach about biodiversity and ecosystems in an engaging and fun way.

The simulation is on display at Visualiseringscenter C in Norrköping and Universeum in Göteborg.

# About

<img style={{float: "right", marginLeft: "1rem"}} width="25%" alt="Absolute image" src="/content/guides/unreal_engine_fisheye_rendering/stitch_example.png" />

This page is a step by step instruction on how to use the Fisheye Render Setup plugin for Unreal Engine to render frames that can be stitched into a fisheye format using our custom stitcher. The plugin allows you take a Camera Sequence in Unreal and render out modified Camera Angles of it, creating _Left_, _Right_, _Top_ and _Bottom_ frames in stereo that can then be stitched into Fisheye frames.

Using Unreal Engine with its real time capabilities to render can speed up production time of movies immensely, as dome movie render times can be reduced from weeks and months to hours and days.

# Making a New Project

1. Create a new project. You can use any of the premade templates that suit your project the best, but for this tutorial we will use a blank project.
2. Make sure you have the following settings in your project. It should be the default settings, with the addition of turning on _Raytracing_

<img style={{display: "block", margin: "auto"}} width="50%" alt="Absolute image" src="/content/guides/unreal_engine_fisheye_rendering/fisheye_plugin_project_settings.png" />

# Project Settings
1. If your computer supports it, turn on _Use Hardware Ray Tracing_ when available
2. Set _Ray Lighting Mode_ to _Hit Lighting_ for reflections

# Installing the Unreal Engine Plugin
1. [Download the plugin](#download-links) matching your Unreal Engine version
2. Add the `FisheyeRenderSetup` folder to your projects Plugins folder. If you don’t have a Plugins folder you can add one.
3. Start your project and check the Plugins browser to see that the plugin is installed
4. Open the Settings menu in your Content Browser and enable _Show Plugin Content_
5. You can now find the `FisheyeRenderSetup` content folder under All > Plugins
6. Right click _LevelSequenceAssetAction_ and select _Run Editor Utility Blueprint_ to ensure that it can be run further down the line

<img style={{display: "block", margin: "auto"}} width="80%" alt="Absolute image" src="/content/guides/unreal_engine_fisheye_rendering/fisheye_plugin_content.png" />

# Level Setup
The following steps assumes that you have a blank scene with nothing in it. You can copy the `DomeFisheyeTemplateLevel` and use it as a starting point if you want to skip the following setup steps in _Light Setup_, _Post Process Volume_ and _Camera Rig_.  Alternatively, you could copy and paste the relevant actors into another level.

## Lighting

1. Go to the Window tab and _Open Environment Light Mixer_
2. Press every button EXCEPT _Atmospheric Light 1_
3. In the outliner, select the Skylight and turn on the _Real Time Capture_ checkbox

<img style={{display: "block", margin: "auto"}} width="80%" alt="Absolute image" src="/content/guides/unreal_engine_fisheye_rendering/fisheye_plugin_light_setup.png" />

## Post Process Volume
1. Add a _Post Process Volume_ to your scene
2. Check _Infinite Extent (Unbound)_ so that the volume affects the whole scene

<img style={{display: "block", margin: "auto"}} width="80%" alt="Absolute image" src="/content/guides/unreal_engine_fisheye_rendering/fisheye_plugin_ppv_unbound.png" />

3. Change the reflection method to _Standalone Ray Traced (Deprecated)_. This sets the reflection method to Hardware instead of software. Lumen is limited in how good reflections it can produce, especially on highly reflective materials. Lumen cheats by using Screen space reflections, but this doesn't work for fisheye renders as objects visible in one camera won't reflect in the others. With Hardware Ray Tracing we get around this problem, with the trade-off being higher rendering time. You can omit this step if you don't have any issues with reflections.
	1. Tweak _Max Roughness_ to set how reflective a material has to be to get a reflection. Lower values include more objects.
	2. Increase _Max Bounces_ to get a more correct reflection. This is costly, so don't go higher than you need.
	3. Increase _Samples Per Pixels_ if your reflective surfaces seem grainy. Higher values will be more costly, as it will cast a ray through each pixel for each level.

4. You need to turn off some screen space effects as they don't work with fisheye stitching. If you have them turned on you will see borders between the stitched images.

	1. Set _Bloom > Intensity_ to 0.0

	<img style={{display: "block", margin: "auto"}} width="80%" alt="Absolute image" src="/content/guides/unreal_engine_fisheye_rendering/fisheye_plugin_ppv_bloom.png" />

	2. Set Image Effects > Vignette Intensity to 0.0

	<img style={{display: "block", margin: "auto"}} width="80%" alt="Absolute image" src="/content/guides/unreal_engine_fisheye_rendering/fisheye_plugin_ppv_vignette.png" />

5. Unreal Engine has _Auto Exposure_ turned on by default (you can also edit this in project settings). We want to turn this off as the exposure should not change between camera angles.
   1. Set _Exposure > Metering Mode_ to Manual
	 2. _Exposure > Turn _Apply Physical Camera Exposure_ Off
	 3. Tweak _Exposure > Exposure Compensation_ to match the lighting you want in your scene

## Camera Rig
We will now create a camera rig that matches the dome we want to render to. The goal is to create a _Camera Transform Actor_ that we control in the animation and attaching a static camera to it that has a different rotation for each camera angle.
1. Add an actor into the level. Name this actor `CameraTransform`
2. Add another actor and name it `DomeTilt`. Attach `DomeTilt` to `CameraTransform` and set its relative rotation to `(0, 63, 0)`. Make sure the other transforms are at default values
3. Add a `CameraActor` to the level and attach it to `DomeTilt`. If you want you can set the relative rotation to `(0, -63, 0)` to make the camera face forward for preview purposes. Make sure the other transforms are at default values. Set the cameras _Aspect Ratio_ to `1.0` and _Post Process Blend Weight_ to `0.0`

## Dome Preview
If you want you can also add a _Dome Preview_, to check how the fisheye view would look in a dome
1. Go to _All > Plugins > FisheyeRenderSetup Content > DomePreview_
2. Add a `DomePreviewSphere`. You can set the dome to be either 180° or 165°, as well as set the dome tilt angle
3. Add a `DomePreviewCamera`. Attach it to `DomeTilt` and make sure the transforms are at default values.
4. Select the `DomePreviewCamera` and press the _Update Camera_ button in the _Details_ menu. The camera view will now be drawn to the `DomePreviewSphere`
5. You can also check _Capture Every Frame_ to have the camera always update but beware of the performance hit

# Creating Sequences
To render out a scene, you need to create sequences that you can render out using the _Movie Render Queue_. The goal is to create a base sequence, and then create duplicates with the adjusted camera angles needed to render out the images we use for stitching together fisheye images.
1. Create a new _Level Sequence_ and open it.
2. Select the `CameraActor` from your rig and drag it into _Sequence_. You should see it be added as a new track, along with a _Camera Cuts_ track. You can also manually create a _Camera Cuts_ track and add your camera to it.
3. Drag in the `CameraTransform` actor and add a _Transform_ track to it. Add keyframes to `CameraTransform`'s transform to animate your camera. You need to add at least one keyframe to keep it in place, even if you plan to have a static camera. (**IMPORTANT** Do not add keyframes to the `CameraActor`. It should remain static as we change it for the camera angles). You could alternatively animate the camera and other objects in a separate sequence and add it as a Subsequence.

<img style={{display: "block", margin: "auto"}} width="80%" alt="Absolute image" src="/content/guides/unreal_engine_fisheye_rendering/fisheye_plugin_sequence_keyframe.png" />

4. If the camera gets too close to an object, the stereo effect will break as the brain can't parse what's going on. Bascially, if the dome surface is 7 meters away, you get a good stereo effect of an object that is 5 meters away. But if the object is 50 cm away, the stereo will be too intense and it will make you nauseous. If this is the case, you might want to adjust the distance between your eyes instead, effectively scaling the user. If you scale down the viewer to 1/10th, 50 cm becomes 5 meters in the eyes of the viewer. To achive this in _Sequencer_, you can keyframe the scale of any parent above the `CameraActor` in hierarchy. This means that the relative location of `CameraActor` in relation to its parent will be scaled, so the normal "eye distance" of 3.5 cm will be 0.35 at 1/10th scale etc.

# Creating Camera Angle Duplicates
Once you have a base _Level Sequence_, you want to create duplicates for each camera angle, as well as eye of you are rendering for stereo. To do this we use scripted functionality from the plugin.
1. Right click your _Level Sequence_ and select _Scripted Asset Action > Make Duplicates with Fisheye Camera Angles_

<img style={{display: "block", margin: "auto"}} width="80%" alt="Absolute image" src="/content/guides/unreal_engine_fisheye_rendering/fisheye_plugin_sequence_keyframe.png" />

2. Now you should see a new folder appearing, containing the new duplicates. The prefix indicates which eye position and camera angle each _Sequence_ contains. For example, `LB_Sequence` is Left eye, Bottom camera angle.

<img style={{display: "block", margin: "auto"}} width="80%" alt="Absolute image" src="/content/guides/unreal_engine_fisheye_rendering/fisheye_plugin_sequence_duplicates.png" />

3. Before you render you should check that the new camera angles are correct. If something seems off, make sure to check in the base sequence that you have assigned a keyed value to `CameraTransform`, and that the `CameraActor` has no keys.
4. If you want to adjust your sequence, make the adjustments in the base _Sequence_ and then redo the duplication step. It should override the old duplicates.

# Render with Movie Render Queue
It is now time to render your sequences. This is done with the _Movie Render Queue_
1. Open _Window > Cinematics > Movie Render Queue_
2. Drag one of the sequences from the _Content Browser_ into the _Movie Render Queue_
3. Open the settings and press _Load/Save Pre-set_. Select the `RenderSettings` pre-set which is part of the plugin. Press _Accept_ to apply the new settings
4. You can now drag in the rest of the sequences, and `RenderSettings` should apply to all of them

<img style={{display: "block", margin: "auto"}} width="80%" alt="Absolute image" src="/content/guides/unreal_engine_fisheye_rendering/fisheye_plugin_mrq.png" />

5. If you want to change something in `RenderSettings`, you can either change it locally for one sequence in the _Movie Render Queue_ window or change it globally by opening the `RenderSettings` file in the plugin folder

   1. In the _Output_ tab you can control various settings, such as where the frames will be saved and under what name, the resolution of your frames and if you want to render a custom set of frames.

<img style={{display: "block", margin: "auto"}} width="80%" alt="Absolute image" src="/content/guides/unreal_engine_fisheye_rendering/fisheye_plugin_mrq_output.png" />

   2. If your desired render resolution is higher than what your computer can manage, you can use the settings in the _High Resolution_ tab to set a tile count which will split each frame into smaller tiles. For example, if you set the tile count to 4, it will split a 4096x4096 image into 4x4 1028x1028 images, which can be rendered on a far less powerful computer. However, if you can manage high resolutions right away it is most likely quicker to render.

<img style={{display: "block", margin: "auto"}} width="80%" alt="Absolute image" src="/content/guides/unreal_engine_fisheye_rendering/fisheye_plugin_mrq_high_res.png" /> 

   3. Should you choose to use _High Resolution_, you will also need to adjust settings in _Anti-Aliasing_. Set the anti-aliasing method to none, as it is not supported for tiled rendering. Instead, you use _Temporal Samples_ to remove any aliasing issues. This creates a number of subframes based on your TS count, captured with a small time difference, which can be averaged to produce a more clean end frame. Increase the count as you see fit to remove any artifacts that may occur, at the cost of higher render times.

<img style={{display: "block", margin: "auto"}} width="80%" alt="Absolute image" src="/content/guides/unreal_engine_fisheye_rendering/fisheye_plugin_mrq_anti_alias.png" />

Be aware that the use of _High Resolution_/_Anti-Alising_ might cause GPU crashes when used together with _Hardware Ray Tracing_. This behavior has been observed in Unreal Engine 5.1/5.2 and seems to be a bug that has been reported to Epic Games. The problem should be resolved in future updates, but an alternative is to use 5.0 where this bug doesn't exist.

# Niagara Systems
As the rendering basically restarts for each camera angle, the scene will simulate again for each render. This means that things like Niagara Particle systems can't have a random factor, as it needs to produce the same result for each render.
1. In your Niagara Emitter/System, make sure that _Emitter > Determinism_ is checked to ensure the same result each render

<img style={{display: "block", margin: "auto"}} width="80%" alt="Absolute image" src="/content/guides/unreal_engine_fisheye_rendering/fisheye_plugin_niagara_determinism.png" />

2. We can control the Niagara System by adding it to our Sequence. Add a Niagara Component track and add a System Life Cycle track to it.

<img style={{display: "block", margin: "auto"}} width="80%" alt="Absolute image" src="/content/guides/unreal_engine_fisheye_rendering/fisheye_plugin_niagara_life_cycle_track.png" />


3.	Right click the Life Cycle track and set _Properties > Age Update Mode_ to _Desired Age_. This makes the sequencer control the life span of the particle system, allowing you to scrub though the simulation with a determined state for each frame.

<img style={{display: "block", margin: "auto"}} width="80%" alt="Absolute image" src="/content/guides/unreal_engine_fisheye_rendering/fisheye_plugin_niagara_life_cycle_properties.png" />

# Making Procedural Materials Deterministic
Some Materials changes with time and other variables that might vary between runs. As this might cause issues with rendering multiple times, we need a deterministic solution. Therefore, you might want to use a _Global Material Collection_ to control a material with the sequencer.
1.	Create a _Materials > Global Parameter Collection_ and open it up
2.	Add any values that you might want to change globally. They can be both scalar and vector parameters
3.	Drag your GPC into a material and select your parameter of choice from the dropdown in the Details menu
4.	Plug the value in as needed, e.g. as the _Time_ input for a _Panner_ node

<img style={{display: "block", margin: "auto"}} width="80%" alt="Absolute image" src="/content/guides/unreal_engine_fisheye_rendering/fisheye_plugin_material_global_param.png" />

5.	Drag your GPC into a sequencer and add the parameter you want to control as a track.
6.	Set keyframes for the parameter and watch as your material changes when playing the sequence.

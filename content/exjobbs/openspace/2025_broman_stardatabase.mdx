## About OpenSpace
[OpenSpace](https://openspaceproject.com) is open-source software that aims to visualize the entire known universe in accurate three-dimensional space.  It is mature science visualization software that can be used by anyone to tell stories about the cosmos and our place in it.

## The Project
The positions of the stars lay the foundation for a lot of the information we know about our universe. However, the telescopes that measure the positions are located on or near Earth and the vast distances to the stars leads to high uncertainties and varying positions in the measurements. This means that different datasets have different positions, even for the same star.

OpenSpace uses star positions for several different visualizations - such as the visualization of our night sky from Earth, constellations, or locations for exoplanet host stars. These representations currently all use their own data for the star positions, which leads to the mismatching positions for different representations. The focus of this project is to create a central database for stars to use within OpenSpace, where different names for one star could be matched to one single position, and utilize that database to improve the existing visualizations related to stars. The database should be easily extendable and allow users to for exmaple add their own names for certain stars. If there is time, part of the project might also include working on improving the visuals of the star visualizations, by utilizing the implemented database.

One challenge of the project is to find an efficient way to combine multiple star datasets. Cross-matching star datasets is not trivial. First, the name/identifier for the same star varies between datasets, and not all star datasets includes all stars. Second, the positions of the star may be given in various coordinate systems. Astronomers also keep identifying more and more stars, and another challenge of this project involves coming up with a solution that makes it easy to update data as we continue to discover our universe. The most extensive star database of all time is the Gaia catalog, currently including over 2000 million stars in the Milky Way. This is however only about 1 percent about all the stars in the galaxy.

This project will require skills in C++ and computer graphics programming. Familiarity with databases, data analysis and/or visualization is also beneficial.

[OpenSpace](https://openspaceproject.com) is an open-source software that aims to visualize our entire known universe in its accurate context.  It is a mature software that can be used by anyone to tell stories about the cosmos and our place in it.  Starting with a previous [thesis](http://liu.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:1686604) by Nisse Bergman and Hanna Timander Bj√∂rknert, this capability has been extended through the use of a WebRTC-based streaming service.  This allows users to connect to a remote OpenSpace instance from their browser and interact with the software as if it was running locally.  While this technique is useful to bring OpenSpace to more people, it also provides the underpinning to be able to control the application in a dome theater or power wall from a tablet.

Both use-cases require a more appropriate UX design of the user interface.  The OpenSpace user interface is written using the [React](https://react.dev/) framework, which is normally rendered on top of the 3D rendering using the Chromium Embedded Framework.  For both targets of this Exjobb, the webpage will be rendered on a separate device in the device's native browser instead.

In the first case of the remote rendering, there is an inevitable delay between the user interface, which is rendered locally in the browser, and the 3D rendering, which is transmitted via WebRTC.  One interesting challenge of this Exjobb is to quantify the acceptable delay and design the user interface in a way that makes this layering of different latencies as transparent and seamless as possible to the user.

In the second case of the tablet-based rendering, the user interface has to be adapted to a more touch-friendly paradigm, while preserving the available features existing in the user interface to tell a predefined story in the immersive environment. In this scenario, the computer performing the actual rendering is usually located close to the tablet, making the delay a negligble issue.

This project will require familiarity with JavaScript/TypeScript, React, Redux, and some familiarity with C++ and is located at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City under supervision of [Prof. Charles Hansen](https://users.cs.utah.edu/~hansen/).
